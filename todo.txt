get:
ch <- data , take advantage of fast path from the sender side
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/chan.go#L159
not the receiver side since that code uses atomic.Load()

Notes:
https://golang.org/ref/mem
Reads and writes of values larger than a single machine word behave
as multiple machine-word-sized operations in an unspecified order.
Alas, we still can not count on write/read from single word value
is atomic at user space code due to underneath hardware differences.
